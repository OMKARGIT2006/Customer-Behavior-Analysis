A leading retail company wants to better understand its customers' shopping behavior in order to improve sales, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The management team has noticed changes in purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and sales channels (online vs. offline). They are particularly interested in uncovering which factors, such as discounts, reviews, seasons, or payment preferences, drive consumer decisions and repeat purchases.
You are tasked with analyzing the company's consumer behavior dataset to answer the following overarching business question:

<h2><a class="anchor" id="Final-Recommendations"></a>Final Recommendations</h2>

* **Focus on the "Young Adult" Crowd:** Since this group is driving the most revenue, the marketing budget should lean heavily into the digital channels they use most.
* **Close the Subscription Gap:** Only 27% of customers are currently subscribers. Offering a "Member-Only" discount or free shipping for sign-ups would turn one-time buyers into steady, recurring revenue.
* **Time Your Outreach:** Most customers shop every 3 months or once a year. The company should send out personalized "We miss you" offers exactly when a customer is statistically due for their next purchase.
* **Boost that 3.75 Rating:** A 3.75 average rating suggests there is room to improve. By investigating reviews in specific categories like "Clothing" or "Accessories," we can address quality issues and push that score toward a 4.5.
* **Streamline the Checkout:** Credit cards and PayPal are the clear favorite payment methods. Ensuring these payment paths are as fast and "one-click" as possible will help lower cart abandonment.
